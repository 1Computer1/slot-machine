# About

A slot machine that's not accurate to real life at all.  

# Example

```js
const { SlotMachine, SlotSymbol } = require('../src/index');

const cherry = new SlotSymbol('cherry', {
    display: 'üçí',
    points: 10,
    weight: 100
});

const money = new SlotSymbol('money', {
    display: 'üí∞',
    points: 100,
    weight: 50
});

const wild = new SlotSymbol('wild', {
    display: '‚ùî',
    points: 10,
    weight: 50,
    wildcard: true
});

const machine = new SlotMachine(3, [cherry, money, wild]);
const results = machine.play();

console.log(results.visualize());
```
